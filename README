Ardour manual

The source is in DocBook (ardour.xml), screenshots are PNG and
diagrams are SVG (created with Inkscape).

There is a Makefile which can build HTML or PDF versions of the
manual.

HTML is generated with xmlto, and uses ardour-html.xsl as a
stylesheet and ardour.css for CSS.  The Makefile converts
the diagrams to PNG using Inkscape.  Output is in the html
subdirectory.

PDF is generated by going to LaTeX with dblatex, which then
compiles the result using pdflatex.  The stylesheet
ardour-pdf.xsl is read, along with ardour.sty for some LaTeX
bits.  There is also a hacky script pptex.py which post-processes
the LaTeX to fix up <sidebar> declarations.  Output is
pdf/ardour.pdf.

make pdf should build the PDF, and make html the HTML, assuming
you have the required tools on your system.
