<title>Configuration</title>

<para>
This chapter gives a reference to the ways in which Ardour's behaviour
can be customised.  Many of the configuration options are described
earlier in the manual; for those options we link back to the relevant
sections.
</para>

<section>
<title>Per-session and global options</title>

<para>
Options are split into two groups: <emphasis>session
properties</emphasis> (accessible from the
<guimenuitem>Properties</guimenuitem> item on the
<guimenu>Session</guimenu> menu and <emphasis>preferences</emphasis>
(accessible from the <guimenuitem>Preferences</guimenuitem> option in
<guimenu>Edit</guimenu>).
</para>

<para>
Session properties can be changed for each different session that you
use.  The intention is that these properties are those whose best
setting depends on the type of session you are working on.
</para>

<para>
Preferences are options which apply to all sessions.  They are options
which depend on your general style of working, and the set up of your
audio system.
</para>

<!-- You can make session properties sort of &lsquo;sticky&rsquo; by using template sessions -->

</section>
<section><title>Session properties</title>

<para>
Session properties are arranged into five groups, whose contents are
discussed below.
</para>

<!-- ==================================================================== -->
<section xml:id="sec-session-properties-timecode"><title>Timecode</title>
<!-- ==================================================================== -->

<section>
<title>External timecode source</title>

<para>
This specifies the place that Ardour should get a timecode signal from
when it is slaving.  The external sync button in the editor window can
be clicked to switch from internal sync to whichever external choice
is made here. The options are:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<emphasis>JACK</emphasis> &mdash; this synchronises Ardour to the JACK transport.
</listitem>
<listitem>
<emphasis>MIDI Timecode</emphasis> &mdash; this makes Ardour chase
MIDI timecode.  The timecode source should be connected to Ardour's
&lsquo;MTC in&rsquo; port.
</listitem>
<listitem>
<emphasis>Midi Clock</emphasis> &mdash; synchronise to MIDI clock;
this should be connected to Ardour's &lsquo;MIDI clock in&rsquo; port.
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

</section>

<section>
<title>Timecode frames-per-second</title>

<para>
This should be set to the frames-per-second count for the timecode
that you are syncing to, or that you want Ardour to generate.
</para>

</section>

<section>
<title>Subframes per frame</title>

<para>
This should be set to the number of subframes per frame for the
timecode you are syncing to, or that you want Ardour to generate.
</para>

</section>

<section>
<title>Timecode source shares sample clock with audio interface</title>

<para>
Enabling this option will make Ardour assume that the timecode is
exactly synchronised with the audio sample clock; in this case, the
two cannot drift apart.
</para>

</section>

<section>
<title>Pull up/pull-down</title>

<para>
This should be set to the pull-up or pull-down for the
timecode you are syncing to, or that you want Ardour to generate.
</para>

</section>

<section>
<title>Timecode offset (and timecode offset negative)</title>

<para>
These options should be set to reflect any required offset between
Ardour's session times and the timecode being received or
generated.
</para>

<para>
If the timecode is &lsquo;ahead&rsquo; of Ardour's timeline, the
offset should be positive; otherwise, set it negative.
</para>

</section>

<section>
<title>Ardour is JACK time master</title>

<para> Enable this option if you are syncing to JACK and you want
Ardour to be the &lsquo;controller&rsquo; of the current time
throughout the system.
</para>

</section>

</section> <!-- Timecode -->

<!-- ============================================================== -->
<section xml:id="sec-session-properties-fades"><title>Fades</title>
<!-- ============================================================== -->

<para>
These options govern the properties of fades involving audio regions.
See <xref linkend="sec-audio-region-fades"/>.
</para>

</section> <!-- Fades -->

<!-- ============================================================== -->
<section xml:id="sec-session-properties-media"><title>Media</title>
<!-- ============================================================== -->

<para>
The <emphasis>audio file format</emphasis> section governs the sample
format, bit depth and file type that Ardour will use when recording
audio.  The sample format can be one of:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
32-bit floating point &mdash; this is the format that Ardour uses
internally for processing, and is the highest quality; it is,
arguably, of higher quality than is required for recording things.
The reason Ardour uses it internally is that processing 32-bit
floating point signals is efficient on modern processors, and the high
bit depth helps reduce potential problems caused by performing
processing operations on audio.
</listitem>
<listitem>
24-bit integer &mdash; as the name suggests; this is a common
recording format as it offers a very high dynamic range (144dB,
without taking dither into account).
</listitem>
<listitem>
16-bit integer &mdash; the bit depth used by standard audio CDs.
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

The file format can be one of:

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
Broadcast WAVE &mdash; an extension of the very common WAVE
(<code>.wav</code>) file format, often used in broadcast, which adds
some metadata to the standard WAVE format.
</listitem>
<listitem>
WAVE &mdash; the Microsoft WAVE format (commonly given a suffix of <code>.wav</code>)
</listitem>
<listitem>
WAVE-64 &mdash; a version of WAVE that can handle files of greater than 4Gb in size.
</listitem>
<listitem>
CAF &mdash; Core Audio Format, as developed by Apple Computer for use on Mac OS X.
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<section><title>DSP CPU Utilization</title>
<!-- ====================================== -->

<para>
If you run Ardour on a computer with more than one processor, or more
than one core, Ardour can make use of all the cores.  It does this by
running the processing of different tracks and busses on different
cores.  This option allows you to specify the number of cores or
processors that Ardour should use for signal processing.  This setting
will only take effect once you re-start Ardour.
</para>

<section><title>Undo</title>
<para>See <xref linkend="sec-undo-and-redo"/></para>
</section>

<!-- ===================================== -->
<section><title>Session management</title>
<!-- ===================================== -->

<para>
The <emphasis>always copy imported files</emphasis> option will force Ardour never
to offer you the option to embed files that you import; they will
always be copied into the session folder.
</para>

<para>
The <emphasis>default folder for new sessions</emphasis> is where Ardour will
initially suggest that you create new sessions.
</para>

<para>
<emphasis>Maximum number of recent sessions</emphasis> dictates the number of recent
sessions that Ardour will offer in the startup dialogue and also in
<guimenuitem>Recent&hellip;</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>Session</guimenu> menu.
</para>

</section> <!-- Session management -->

<!-- ======================= -->
<section><title>Click</title>
<!-- ======================= -->

<para>
This section allows you to specify the sound files that will be used
for the click; the &lsquo;emphasis&rsquo; audio file will be used for the first
beat of the bar.  The <emphasis>click gain level</emphasis> adjusts the volume of
the click.
</para>

</section> <!-- Click -->

<section><title>Automation</title>
<!-- ============================= -->

</section> <!-- Automation -->

</section> <!-- Misc -->

<!-- ============================ -->
<section><title>Transport</title>
<!-- ============================ -->

<itemizedlist>
<listitem> <emphasis>Keep record-enable engaged on stop</emphasis> &mdash; selecting this
  option will mean that after a recording pass, the main session
  record-enable will remain switched on; otherwise it will be switched
  off when the transport stops.
</listitem><listitem> <emphasis>Stop recording when an xrun occurs</emphasis> &mdash; an xrun (see
  <xref linkend="sec-xruns"/>) during recording could well mean that the
  recording has been corrupted by a small (or not-so-small) pop or
  click.  If this option is enabled, recording will stop if an xrun is
  detected, which may be useful to draw the fact to your attention.
  It may <emphasis>not</emphasis> be desirable on long or unattended recording
  sessions!
</listitem><listitem> <emphasis>Create markers where xruns occur</emphasis> &mdash; a less drastic
  option for observing xruns is to enable this option, which creates a
  marker wherever in a session an xrun occurs during recording.  The
  marker makes it easy to check out the area later and inspect the
  damage.
</listitem><listitem> <emphasis>Stop at the end of the session</emphasis> &mdash; if this is enabled,
  the transport will stop at the end-of-session marker <!-- (does it
    stop during record too?) -->
</listitem><listitem> <emphasis>Do seamless looping &mdash; <!-- hmm! --></emphasis>
</listitem><listitem> <emphasis>Primary clock delta to edit cursor</emphasis>
</listitem><listitem> <emphasis>Secondary clock delta to edit cursor</emphasis>
</listitem><listitem> <emphasis>Disable per-track record disarm while rolling</emphasis> &mdash; if
  this is enabled it will be impossible to disarm a track from
  recording while the transport is moving.  This may be useful as a
  safety feature to prevent unwitting clicks on record enable buttons
  from dropping tracks out of record.
</listitem><listitem> <emphasis>12dB gain reduction during fast-forward and fast-rewind</emphasis>
  &mdash; fast-forward/rewind can, by their nature, generate
  unpleasant-sounding transients and high-frequency content which may
  be trying to tired ears.  With this option enabled, Ardour will drop
  the output by 12dB when doing &lsquo;winds&rsquo;.
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>

</section> <!-- Transport -->

<!-- ================================================================ -->
<section xml:id="sec-ardour-preferences-editor"><title>Editor</title>
<!-- ================================================================ -->

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<emphasis>Link selection of regions and tracks</emphasis> &mdash; with this
  enabled, when a region is seleted its track will be too.
</listitem>
<listitem>
<emphasis>Move relevant automation when audio regions are moved</emphasis>
  &mdash; when enabled, this means that moving a region will also move any
  automation at the same time as that region.
</listitem>
<listitem>
<emphasis>Show meters on tracks in the editor</emphasis> &mdash; enable this to
  show meters next to the track controls area for each track.
  Disabling it will provide a slight drop in CPU load.
</listitem>
<listitem>
<emphasis>Use overlap equivalency for regions} &mdash; <!-- ?! --></emphasis>
</listitem><listitem> <emphasis>Make rubberband selection rectangle snap to the grid</emphasis>
  &mdash; when selecting things by dragging a &lsquo;rubberband&rsquo; or &lsquo;lassoo&rsquo;
  rectangle, this option makes that rectangle snap to any active grid.
</listitem><listitem> <emphasis>Show waveforms in regions</emphasis> &mdash; this option draws
  waveforms within audio regions.  Disable it to ease the load on your
  CPU a bit.
</listitem><listitem> <emphasis>Show gain envelopes in audio regions</emphasis> &mdash; enable this to
  display region gain lines (see <xref linkend="sec-audio-region-gain"/>)
</listitem><listitem> <emphasis>Waveform scale</emphasis> &mdash; this alters the scale used to plot
  audio waveforms within regions between linear and logarithmic (ie in
  dBs).
</listitem><listitem> <emphasis>Waveform shape</emphasis> &mdash; waveforms can either be plotted
  traditionally (so that negative excursions of the waveform are
  plotted as such), or rectified (so that negative excursions are
  drawn as positive ones).
</listitem><listitem> <emphasis>Show waveforms for audio while it is being recorded</emphasis> &mdash;
  disabling this will prevent Ardour from generating waveforms for
  regions during record; again, this will lighten the load on your CPU
  a bit.
</listitem><listitem> <emphasis>Show zoom toolbar</emphasis> &mdash; disable this to hide the zoom
  toolbar, which may help the editor window to fit better on small
  screens.
</listitem><listitem> <emphasis>Color regions using their track's color</emphasis> &mdash; this will
  draw the trim bar of each region using the same colour as has been
  assigned to its track. <!-- if not? -->
</listitem><listitem> <emphasis>Update editor window during drags of the summary</emphasis> &mdash; if
  this option is on, as you drag the view rectangle in the summary
  (see <xref linkend="sec-summary"/>) the editor will be updated
  instantly.  This can be a bit slow for complicated sessions; turning
  this option off will mean that the editor only updates when you
  finish the drag.
</listitem><listitem> <emphasis>Synchronise editor and mixer track order</emphasis> &mdash; with this
  option enabled the order of the tracks in the editor window will
  match the order in the mixer; with it turned off, the track order
  can be different.
</listitem><listitem> <emphasis>Synchronise editor and mixer selection</emphasis> &mdash; with this
  option turned on, selecting a track in the editor will select it in
  the mixer, and vice-versa; otherwise selections are independent.
</listitem><listitem> <emphasis>Name new markers</emphasis> &mdash; if this is set, when you click on
  &lsquo;New Marker&rsquo; in the <emphasis>Locations</emphasis> window (or the locations editor
  list), the newly-created marker's name will be set to get the
  keyboard focus so that you can name it easily.
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>

</section> <!-- Editor -->

<!-- ======================== -->
<section><title>Audio</title>
<!-- ======================== -->

<!-- ============================ -->
<section><title>Buffering</title>
<!-- ============================ -->

<para>
These options govern how much memory Ardour will use to buffer signals
going out for playback, and coming in for record.  Larger buffers
provide more &lsquo;safety&rsquo;, in that there is more data prepared to cope
with temporary slowness with your hard discs, but require more memory.
It is not uncommon to set rather long capture buffer lengths (around a
minute or more) to help ensure trouble-free recordings.
</para>

</section>

<!-- ============================= -->
<section><title>Monitoring</title>
<!-- ============================= -->

<para>
The options here are:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<emphasis>Use a monitor bus</emphasis> &mdash; as discussed in
  <xref linkend="sec-mute-and-solo"/>, this instructs Ardour to use a
  monitor bus, allowing the AFL/PFL features and the more advanced &lsquo;monitor section&rsquo; in the mixer window.
</listitem>
<listitem>
<emphasis>Record monitoring handled by</emphasis> &mdash; this
dictates how monitoring of incoming signals should be handled; this
can be by the audio hardware (in which case Ardour does nothing), by
JACK (in which case Ardour tells JACK how the monitoring should be) or
by Ardour (in which case Ardour does things itself).  See <xref linkend="sec-monitoring"/> for a full discussion.
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

</section> <!-- Monitoring -->

<!-- ================================================== -->
<section><title>Connection of tracks and busses</title>
<!-- ================================================== -->
<para>See <xref linkend="sec-automatic-connections"/>.</para>
</section>


<!-- ============================ -->
<section><title>Denormals</title>
<!-- ============================ -->

<para>
&lsquo;Denormals&rsquo; are very small floating point numbers which can be
generated on occasion by Ardour and also by plugins.  On some CPUs, in
some situations, these can cause processing to slow down by a very
large factor (10 times or more).  This in turn can cause problems with
high CPU loads and xruns.
</para>

<sidebar>
<para>
The reason CPUs slow down is that in some cases they think it more
important to maintain precision with very small numbers than to
process them quickly.  This is true for many applications, but not for
audio.  The numbers involved are so small (usually around the
<inlineequation><alt>10^{-16}</alt>1e-16</inlineequation> range) that small errors in their processing are, in most
cases, inaudible.  For audio applications it is generally preferable
to lose some precision in order to keep things moving quickly.
</para>
</sidebar>

<para>
Ardour has a few strategies to deal with denormals, controlled by
these settings:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<emphasis>Use DC bias to protect against denormals</emphasis> &mdash; this adds a
small DC value to strategic points in the signal processing chain.
This is not the most efficient way to do things, but can be helpful in
some circumstances.
</listitem>
<listitem>
<emphasis>Processor handling</emphasis> &mdash; most modern (post
year 2000) CPUs have configuration options themselves to help with
denormals.  These are called &lsquo;Flush to zero&rsquo; and &lsquo;Denormals are zero&rsquo;.
If these options are available on your machine (they will be
desensitized if not), it is worth enabling them both as they are
likely to solve the problem efficiently.
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

</section> <!-- Denormals -->

<!-- ========================== -->
<section><title>Plugins</title>
<!-- ========================== -->

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<emphasis>Silence plugins when the transport is stopped</emphasis>
&mdash; when enabled, this option will &lsquo;flush&rsquo; all plugins
when the transport is stopped.  This will prevent plugins such as
delays and reverbs from continuing to sound when stop is pressed.
</listitem>
<listitem>
<emphasis>Disable plugins during recording</emphasis> &mdash; this
will turn off all plugins during recording, which may help to ensure
trouble-free recordings if you have a complicated session which is
running on the limits of your CPU power.
</listitem>
<listitem>
<emphasis>Make new plugins active</emphasis> &mdash; enabling this
option will make newly-added plugins active by default.
</listitem>
<listitem>
<emphasis>Enable automatic analysis of audio</emphasis> &mdash; <!-- think this should be reworked -->
</listitem>
<listitem>
<emphasis>Replicate missing region channels</emphasis> &mdash;
